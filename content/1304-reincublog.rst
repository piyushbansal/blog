:summary: Reincublog is a super mini Django blog weekend hack, coded as part of a recruitment process.

Reincublog is a Django app that I was asked to code as part of the recruitment process at `Reincubate <http://www.reincubate.com/>`_. It's a weekend of glue code which I was set to see if I am a competent Django programmer. I'm not sure that it's the kind of test that I show my best at - I'm more of an algorithm guy.

However, after living on GitHub for a few months, the repo has picked up a couple of stars, and because I like to keep a super clean GitHub account, I've decided to clean it out of my account.

So, from today the `Reincublog code <https://github.com/shonenada/reincublog>`_ will live on `shonenada's GitHub <https://github.com/shonenada>`_ hopefully it can grow and be useful.
