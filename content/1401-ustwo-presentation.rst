:summary: A presentation I made at ustwo's Tech Thursday about Seinfeld
          Technique and how it can help coders to get their personal projects
          moving.


This presentation focuses on using the Seinfeld method "Don't break the chain"
to get going with personal projects. Those could be all types of things from
learning the piano, a new programming language or achieving a personal goal.

I believe that the Seinfeld method can help break down some of the blockers
that we experience when procrastinating, by forcing us to refactor large,
unmeasurable and daunting tasks into mini-tasks which are the opposite -
achievable, simple and regular. It also helps us to refocus on continual small
steps rather than the big picture.

I'm especially keen on how the regular measurement of time spent on a project
can give insight, and so I've started combining Seinfeld with Pomodoro
Technique.

The most important thing is to "make it work for you" - there are all sorts of
ways that these techniques can be used to push a project forward or help you to
achieve your goal.

Hope that's helpful!
