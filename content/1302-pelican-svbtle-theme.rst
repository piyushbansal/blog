:summary: A tweaked fork of the Pelican Svbtle theme with some cleaned CSS and HTML.

My first experiments with `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_ to run this blog have been good - it's a great way to publish static pages quickly and I find it much easier to manage than Octopress.

It's built on a version of the `Pelican-svbtle theme <https://github.com/wting/pelican-svbtle>`_. There were some problems with the theme in its current form, so I've forked `CNBorn's already adjusted version <https://github.com/CNBorn/pelican-svbtle>`_ and cleaned out some of the LESS and templates - `my fork is on GitHub <https://github.com/jamescooke/pelican-svbtle>`_.

However, this theme isn't going to stay. `Paul <http://www.thesocialspaces.co.uk/>`_ has been working on some flat HTML based on Bootstrap to make a new clean theme. Once that's stable, I'll plug in some Pelican / Jinja2 tags and hopefully this site will have a new clean theme soon.
