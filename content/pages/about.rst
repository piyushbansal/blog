Hello, I am Piyush
##################

I am a Junior at IIIT Hyderabad, studying Computer Science. 
I am passionate about Information retreival, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence. 

I am currently working in fields of Social Network Analysis with `Prof. Vasudeva Varma <http://www.iiit.ac.in/~vasu>`_ and 
Automated Book Summarisation and Structured information extraction from books with `Prof. Manish Gupta <http://dais.cs.uiuc.edu/manish/>`_.

I am also a strong supporter of Open Source, and work with `Google Open Source Programs Office <http://google-melange.com>`_ to help propagate FOSS via programs like `GSoC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code>`_ and `GCI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Code-in>`_.

I worked on automated acceptance testing for `Melange - a part of Google Open Source Programs Office <http://google-melange.com>`_ last summer. This summer I am excited to be working with `LinkedIn <http://linkedin.com>`_ on Intrusion Detection Systems as a `Data Science Intern`.

I believe that the simplest of ideas can bring the biggest change to the world as we know it. Love is a powerful emotion, and I find myself immensely attracted to memes on the interwebs, like `doge <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)>`_ and `cate <http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/cate>`_.

I disagree with `xkcd <https://xkcd.com/224/>`_ and am convinced that god hacked the universe in **python**. I believe in power of random incidents and decisions.

I like to think that I can sing, though dance is not my thing.
