:summary: A newly structured documentation site and tutorial for the online editor.

`Updated documentation <http://doc.jsfiddle.net/>`_ for `jsFiddle <http://jsfiddle.net/>`_, `merged by Piotr <https://github.com/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-docs-alpha/commit/ef0f234e44e5a6d6791c09e672364fdf9518a31a>`_.

Includes a new `tutorial <http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html>`_ - but images are already out of date!

jsFiddle is such a great tool and my goal for the tutorial was to create a simple introduction which first time students would be able to understand and execute.
